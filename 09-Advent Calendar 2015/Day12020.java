/*
Have some variables(ints number)
Then could use number.length to see how many numbers there are
Maybe use try statement, create a for(int i = 0; i < number.length; i++)
Then could be using one number and add every other number to see if equal to 2020
If they are equal to 2020 then mutiply them to get answer and print out answer
